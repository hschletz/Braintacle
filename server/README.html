<h1>Braintacle's patched version of OCS Inventory NG</h1>

<h2>About this version</h2>

<p>
This is a patched version of the <a href="https://ocsinventory-ng.org">OCS inventory NG</a>
server that works with PostgeSQL in addition to MySQL and handles some
incompatible changes in Braintacle's database schema.
