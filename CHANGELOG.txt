- Required: Run "composer install" from the Braintacle root directory to
  update dependencies.

Misc:

- Fixed PHP 8.1 compatibility.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9
======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run "composer install" from the Braintacle root directory to
  update dependencies.

- Recommended: The above step may leave the directory public/components behind.
  It is no longer used and should be deleted manually.

Security:

- This release updates the laminas-form component with a fix for
  GHSA-jq4p-mq33-w375.

Misc:

- Server: Backported changes from version 2.9.

- Server: Respond with 405 status code for non-POST requests instead of 403.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8
======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run "braintacle-tool.php database" to update the database.

- The command line tool (braintacle-tool.php) has been rewritten and now accepts
  a verbosity flag (-v, -vv, -vvv) for all commands. The "export" command
  previously used -v as a shortcut for --validate. This shortcut has been
  removed.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed exception when editing an IPv6 subnet.

Misc:

- Fixed PHP 8 compatibility.

- API documentation is now generated via phpDocumentor 3. A suitable config file
  is included. Simply invoke phpDocumentor. It can be installed via PHIVE
  (https://phar.io) for which a config file is included too.
  "braintacle-tool.php apidoc" still works, it expects the tools/phpDocumentor
  executable. PHIVE will install it to this location.

- Abandoned dependencies have been removed.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7
======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: The database schema for installed software has changed. If you have
  any software searches stored as a search parameter for groups, these groups
  will cause errors. Delete these groups before the upgrade and re-create them
  later.

- Required: Run "braintacle-tool.php database" to update the database.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed handling of IPv6 networks.

- Console: Fixed counting of inventoried clients in network listing when clients
  have more than 1 interface in the same network.

- Console: Fixed warning in package builder with empty fragment size on PHP 7.1+.

Misc:

- Server: Backported changes from version 2.8.

Fixed bugs:

- Fixed uninstallable dependency on PHP 5.6.

Misc:

- Console: link-local address ranges are no longer listed as networks.

- Added basic support for inventoried network information with IPv6 addresses.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Check the additional dependencies listed in README.md.

- Required: Braintacle uses a new config file (braintacle.ini) which replaces
  the database.ini file from earlier versions. This file must be set up from
  scratch (see the instructions in the template) - renaming is not sufficient.

- Required: Run "composer install" from the Braintacle root directory to
  download dependencies. Previous installations of Zend Framework and NADA and
  their include_path configuration can be removed if not used otherwise.

- Required: Run "braintacle-tool.php database" to update the database schema.

- Required: The directory with the server code has been renamed to "server".
  Adjust the "PerlSwitches -I" directive in your Apache configuration to point
  to the new path.

- Required: The database is no longer compatible with OCS Inventory NG. If you
  used both applications in parallel, see the migration section in INSTALL.md
  for further instructions.

- Required: Connections to MySql/MariaDB databases use the "utf8mb4" encoding.
  Convert existing databases to that encoding. This is not done automatically.

- Recommended: Passwords are now stored as a bcrypt hash. All users should log
  in once to have their hash updated automatically. The database update script
  will warn about any old hashes.

- Recommended: If you generated the API documentation, remove the doc/api
  directory before re-generating.

New features:

- Console: After being redirected to the login page from an unauthenticated
  request, redirect to the original page after successful login. This simplifies
  quick access to particular pages via bookmarks etc.

- Console: The search form has been simplified a bit, with the "Exact match"
  field merged into the "Operator" field, which now describes the previously
  undocumented wildcard usage.

- Tools: All end-user CLI scripts, previously present in the "tools" directory,
  have been merged into a single script "braintacle-tool.php" in the main
  directory.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed inconsistent navigation (missing submenu and/or active menu not
  highlighted) on some pages.

- Console: Fixed display of some characters incorrectly encoded by old agents

- Console: Updated package download URLs did not affect existing packages.

- Console: Package notification messages (pre- and postinstall) were not
  displayed properly under certain circumstances. The package builder now
  prepares messages for correct interpretation by the agent. There is one
  limitation in the agent itself: Messages can contain arbitrary HTML markup
  which is parsed and displayed correctly, but attribute values must be enclosed
  in single quotes. HTML attributes in double quotes may not work as expected.

- Console: Detection of ZIP archives by the package builder has become more
  reliable. This feature and the auomatic archive creation are now optional,
  though strongly recommended, and a warning is issued if PHP's Zip extension
  is not available.

Misc:

- An alternative config file can be set via the BRAINTACLE_CONFIG environment
  variable for all applications.

- Support for some previously deprecated options has been dropped. They are
  removed from the database during upgrade, enforcing sensible default behavior
  by legacy code that tries to evaluate them. They also no longer show up in the
  preferences dialogs.

- Packages can now be stored in an arbitrary directory. The directory name no
  longer has to be "download".

- The database manager unconditionally converts the database to the latest
  schema, disregarding backward compatibility. The --force flag has been
  removed.

- Non-admin accounts are removed from the database. These have intentionally
  never been functional.

- The ocsreports application has been removed.

- Console: The download URLs can no longer be set per package. The global
  options, which have been moved to the "Download" preferences section, are
  always used for package creation. Multiple download locations have never been
  supported, and multiple URLs are not very useful with a single location.

- Console: The certificate path can no longer be set. Recent agents ignore the
  server-supplied paths in favour of local configuration.

- Console: The package download is no longer tested after building a package.
  This test has never been reliable, and failure would be a global
  configuration issue, not a problem with individual packages.

- Console: The display of the maximum file size in the package builder form has
  been removed as it was generally unreliable.

- Console: Some peripheal items (extension slots, controllers) are no longer
  searchable because the data is provided inconsistently by different agents.

- Console: The "invert results" search operation now behaves consistently across
  all argument types (string, numeric, date). Previously, the operation behaved
  differently for string arguments.

- Tools: API documentation is now generated using ApiGen.

- Tools: Removed update-from-git.sh.

- Server: Updated server to version 2.3.1.

- Server: Removed SOAP interface which has never been supported or tested.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.16
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: The server log path is no longer settable through the console and
  the config stored in the database is ignored. It must be set in the server
  configuration file because it may be used before a database connection is
  established. Check your Apache config for correct log path.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed errors and warnings with ZF 1.12.8.

- Console: Fixed bug in package builder error cleanup.

- Console: Fixed OS detection for computers imported via the injector script.

- Console: Fixed display of software size for Unix machines (wrong magnitude).

- Console: Fixed orphaned database rows after deleting a computer.

Misc:

- Server: Added a partial workaround for a bug in the UNIX agent (LP#1436702)
  where storage device size may be misreported. The server does not have the
  information to fix it, but removes invalid (non-integer) values that would
  cause the inventory process to fail.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.15
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run tools/schema-manager.php to update the database schema.

- Recommended: Upgrade Zend Framework to 1.12.8 or later.

New features:

- Console: Partial support for extended download options (forced/scheduled
  download etc.) introduced by new server version. There is no user interface
  yet to set these options, but they are gracefully handled when updating/
  assigning/deleting packages.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed possible XSS.

- Console: Fixed exception when searching for an empty string with exact match.

- Console: When deleting a computer, unchecking the "Delete interfaces from
  network listing" checkbox had no effect.

- Console: Ultimate fix for the locking problem insufficiently addressed in the
  previous release.

Misc:

- Server: Updated server to version 2.1.2.

- General: Minimum ZF version is now 1.12.8.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.14
=======================

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed possible XSS.

- Console: Fixed fatal error when a locking conflict occurs.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.13
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Recommended: Starting with this release, all major features are avalable in
  the Braintacle console. obsoleting the bundled ocsreports. If you have set up
  ocsreports, consider removing it from your web server configuration. It will
  be removed entirely in the next major release.

- Recommended: The Apache configuration for the console has been improved. The
  previous configuration should continue to work for most sites, but should be
  re-created from the new template (config/braintacle-console.conf.template)

New features:

- Console: Added individual configuration for computers and groups (via the
  "Configuration" button). Note that some options are not shown if they are
  disabled globally or in a group of which a computer is a member.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed exception when exporting computers with inventoried registry
  data.

- Console: Fixed incorrect display of duplicates if a group has the same name as
  a computer.

Misc:

- Server: The inventory cache is now permanently disabled. Configuration is
  ignored. It was disabled by default, but never worked with Braintacle if
  enabled. This feature is deprecated anyway and there are no plans to fix it.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.12
=======================

New features:

- Console: Management of inventoried registry keys. In the "Registry" section of
  an inventoried Windows computer or in Preferences->Inventory, click the
  "Manage inventoried values" link.
  This form also enables turning registry inspection on/off, in addition to the
  "Inventory" preferences dialog.

- Console: The full registry value of inventoried registry data is shown as a
  tooltip over its name.

- Console: Inventoried registry values are shown in a separate column, separate
  from the data.

- Console: Added search for registry values/data. For every defined value there
  is 1 entry in the search dropdown. The search operates on both the value and
  the data for that value.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed error when displaying userdefined columns with names containing
  commas.

- Console: Fixed nonstandard (ZF-Style) URL parameter syntax in navigation and
  redirect URLs.

- Console: Fixed invalid markup for HTML elements without content.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.11
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Some external libraries (Zend Framework and NADA) are no longer
  included in the distribution. They must be installed manually. See INSTALL.md
  for more information.

- Recommended: If you added "AllowEncodedSlashes On" to your Apache
  configuration, as told in previuos installation instructions, remove it.
  Braintacle is no longer affected by this directive, which should be left at
  its default setting unless required by other applications.

New features:

- Console: Groups can now be created from search results. Queries can be set on
  groups, results can be added or excluded.

- Console: Group page shows excluded computers.

- Console: The Network page displays an additional table with all defined device
  types and the number of identified devices per type. A link below that table
  leads to a form that allows adding, renaming and deleting device types. Only
  types that are not assigned to any device can be deleted.

- Console: Subnet properties can be edited.

- Tools: New script update-from-git.sh for installations that run directly off
  a git tree. The script takes care of pulling the latest changes and updating
  the database if necessary.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Fixed display of package creation dates (0.10 regression)

- Console: Display printers for non-Windows systems too. Note: the UNIX agent
  support for printers is rather limited.

- Console: No longer relies on Apache's AllowEncodedSlashes setting.

- Tools: Fixed various problems with the schema manager.

Misc:

- Console: Updated the database that determines the vendor from a MAC address.

- Console: Users can no longer lock themselves out by deleting their own
  account.

- Console: Translations are now read directly from the shipped .po-files, thus
  eliminating the need to compile them to .mo format first.

- Tools: The script update-translation.php is no longer needed by end users and
  has been moved to the development directory. The --noextract option is no
  longer supported as extracting strings is now the script's only purpose (no
  .mo compilation any more).

- General: Documentation overhaul. Installation instructions are now gathered in
  a single file, INSTALL.md.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.10
=======================

Upgrading from previous versions:

- Required: Run tools/schema-manager.php to update the database schema.

- Recommended: If you are using the bundled communication server (not the
  original OCS Inventory NG server), remove all PerlModule directives, except
  for Apache::DBI, from the Apache config file to improve server stability.

New features:

- Server/Console: Support for MSofficeKey plugin
  (http://wiki.ocsinventory-ng.org/index.php/Plugins:MSofficeKey)

- Console: Userdefined fields can now be added, renamed or deleted. The database
  representation of field names has been reorganized so that all constraints and
  potential SQL problems are gone.

- Console: Support entering and searching for a Windows product key different
  from the inventoried one. This can be useful if the inventoried key is
  incorrect, which can happen with some license types.

- Console: Licenses overview page. This is intended to become a simple software
  license management system. For now, it only shows a link to manually entered
  Windows product keys.

- Console: The agent whitelist file, which is required by the server to accept
  non-OCS agents like FusionInventory Agent, can now be set in the preferences.
  The file itself must still be maintained manually on the server.

- Console: The preferences dialog complains if only raw zlib compressed
  inventory requests are accepted. Non-zlib requests are required for manual
  inventory upload.

- Tools: New command line tool (decode-ocsfiles.pl) for decoding compressed
  inventory data.

- Server: Load all required Perl modules (except Apache::DBI) automatically, no
  more need to load them in Apache configuration. This makes Apache more robust
  against missing modules. Previously, a missing module would prevent Apache
  startup altogether. Now the impact of missing module is limited to the
  communication server, not affecting other sites hosted by the same Apache
  instance.

- General: Made database name configurable in all components. Some parts had
  previously hardcoded 'ocsweb', which is still used as default if no database
  name is configured. The config templates default to 'braintacle'.

Fixed bugs:

- Console: Always export all software, regardless of blacklist.

- Console: When searching on integer or date fields, the search argument was not
  validated.

Misc:

- General: Documentation overhaul.

- General: Templates for all configuration files are now gathered in a single
  location (config/*.template).

- Server: Rebranding in syslog identification. Syslog messages are now prefixed
  with 'braintacle-server' instead of 'ocsinventory-server'.

- Server: Don't flood Apache log when an option is not explicitly configured and
  a default value is applied instead.

- Console: Improved error reporting.

- Database: The default configuration no longer uses any bad values that the
  preferences dialogs would complain about.

- Database: The GUI_VERSION option, which is used by ocsreports to keep track of
  the database schema version, is no longer touched. Braintacle uses its own
  schema versioning, and once the schema is updated by Braintacle, compatibility
  with original OCS Inventory NG is lost anyway.

- Tools: API documentation is now generated using phpDocumentor 2.

- General: Updated Zend Framework to 1.12.1.

- General: Some internal code restructuring, details can be found in the SVN
  log.
