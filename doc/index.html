<h1>Braintacle documentation</h1>

<h2>Project website</h2>

<p>
Braintacle is hosted at <a href="https://hschletz.github.io/Braintacle">https://hschletz.github.io/Braintacle</a>.
</p>


<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
Braintacle is a set of applications for managing hard- and software on a
network. Braintacle keeps a semi-automatic inventory of computers, other
network-connected devices and installed software, and provides a generic
infrastructure for downloading files and executing commands on selected clients,
allowing centralized software updates, remote configuration and more. For
developers, a PHP API is provided to access the inventory and control the
applications.
</p>
<p>
The application consists of several parts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A patched version of the <a href="https://ocsinventory-ng.org">OCS Inventory NG</a> server with several improvements,
most notably the support for different database backends (PostgreSQL is recommended, but MySQL is still supported).
It is contained in the <em>server</em> directory.
See the <a href="../server/README.html">README.html</a> file in the same directory for details.
</li>
<li>
A web administration console.
</li>
<li>
Some command line helper applications.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Differences to OCS Inventory NG</h2>

<p>
The web administration console is a completely different application which replaces the "ocsreports" part.
</p>

<h3>Extra features and limitations</h3>

<h4>Access control</h4>

<p>
Braintacle does not implement different access privileges.
</p>

<h4><a name="packagebuilder">Package builder</a></h4>

<h5>Editing packages</h5>

<p>
Braintacle allows editing existing packages.
More precisely, by clicking on the name of a package you invoke the package builder with the old package's metadata already filled in.
The package content itself does not get copied to the new package, so you have to upload a file again.
This limitation is OK for the typical scenario where you deploy a new software version, so you would have to upload a new file anyway.
</p>
<p>
After the new package has been successfully built, it will optionally be deployed to clients which already had the old package marked for deployment.
Then the old package is deleted.
For this reason, the new package needs a different name (typically a different version number appended) because for a brief period of time, both packages exist and package names have to be unique.
If anything goes wrong with building the new package, the old package will not be touched.
</p>

<h5>On-the-fly ZIP compression</h5>

<p>
If you want to deploy a single file, having to wrap it into a ZIP archive before uploading can be annoying.
Braintacle creates the archive on the fly if the uploaded file is not a ZIP archive (currently only implemented for Windows packages).
Since the PHP Zip extension's capabilities are limited and ressource usage can grow high for huge files, you can bypass this feature by creating the archive manually before upload.
</p>

<h5>Only 1 download server supported</h5>

<p>
Braintacle supports only 1 download server.
This simplifies not only the code, but also the workflow.
If ressource usage is a problem on your server, you should consider solving the problem outside the application.
For example, you could force usage of a caching proxy on external sites or set up a load balancer.
Once set up this may be easier to handle than having to deal with this everytime you build a new package.
</p>

<h5>Automatic activation</h5>

<p>
The limitation to 1 download server allows package creation and activation to be merged into a single step.
The download locations must be specified at build time, where defaults can be provided.
</p>

<h4><a name="softwarefilter">Software filter</a></h4>

<p>
OCS Inventory provides a function called "software dictionaries" where pieces of installed software can be tagged to be ignored.
This is intended for interaction with <a href="https://www.glpi-project.org">GLPI</a>.
The OCS Inventory console only provides an interface to define these lists, but does not make use of it.
</p>
<p>
The Braintacle console makes use of this list and does not display any software which is tagged to be ignored.
There is an option to display all software anyway.
Note that the database format for this list has changed and is no longer compatible with GLPI.
</p>
<p>
Some software (like MS Office 2007) causes multiple identical entries in a client's inventory.
These duplicate entries are hidden by default, but can be shown with a single mouseclick if you are really interested.
</p>

<h4>Installing packages on a client</h4>

<p>
The list of installable packages does not contain already installed packages, which would only end up with ERR_ALREADY_SETUP.
If a package is not in the list, it would not be installable anyway.
This also keeps the list as short as possible.
</p>

<h4>Managing Windows product keys</h4>

<p>
In addition to the automatically collected Windows license key, a key can be
entered manually. This can be useful if the reported key is garbage (this can
happen in certain situations) or if licenses have been reassigned within an
organization.
</p>

<h4>Managing duplicates</h4>

<p>
Braintacle supports a blacklist for asset tags, in addition to serials and MAC addresses.
</p>
<p>
The information to be merged can be specified in detail:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Custom fields, if selected, will be preserved from the oldest entry.
</li>
<li>
Configuration, if selected, will be combined from all older entries. If a value
is configured on more than 1 merged client, the most recent one takes
precedence.
</li>
<li>
Manual group assignments, if selected, will be combined from all older entries.
</li>
<li>
Package assignments, if selected, will be combined from all older entries.
The package history is intentionally not preserved.
The typical origin of duplicates is a reinstall, where this would just get in the way.
</li>
<li>
The manually entered Windows product key, if selected, will be used from the
most recent entry where one is set.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The command line tool</h2>

<p>
The <em>braintacle-tool.php</em> script provides some functions that are not
provided by the web console.
Available commands are listed when invoking the script without arguments.
Help for individual commands is availabe via
</p>
<p><code>braintacle-tool.php help &lt;command&gt;</code></p>
<p>
A non-default config file can be set via the <code>--config</code> command line
option or the BRAINTACLE_CONFIG environment variable. If not set, the default
file config/braintacle.ini is used. If both are set, the command line
option takes precedence.
</p>


<h3>database</h3>

<p>
The "database" subcommand is used to manage the database schema as part of the
installation and upgrade process as described in
<a href="../INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a>.
There is an optional parameter for the log level (default: info):
</p>
<p><code>
--loglevel=emerg|alert|crit|err|warn|notice|info|debug
</code></p>
<p>
By default, obsolete tables and columns are only dropped if they would block the
upgrade otherwise.
A warning is issued for other obsolete tables and columns.
The --prune or -p option will unconditionally drop these objects too.
</p>

<h3>export</h3>

<p>
The "export" subcommand exports all clients in the database to a given directory.
It will generate 1 XML file per client.
The generated files can optionally be validated via the --validate switch.
</p>

<h3>import</h3>

<p>
The "import" subcommand imports the client from the given file (compressed or
uncompressed XML). It is equivalent to the "Import" button in the console.
</p>

<h3>build</h3>
<p>
The "build" subcommand creates a package from the command line.
This is useful if a file is too big to be uploaded to the webserver.
It can also be used as part of a package builder script.
</p>
<p>
It is limited to the package builder defaults.
Only the name and the file itself can be specified.
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to change permissions/ownership of the generated directory and files.
Otherwise the webserver won't be able to read and/or delete them.
You could also use <code>su</code> to run this script with the UID of the webserver:
</p>
<pre>
su -c 'php braintacle-tool.php build PackageName install-Package.exe' www-data
</pre>

<h3>decode</h3>

<p>
The "decode" subcommand decodes a compressed inventory file as created locally by some agents.
It takes the file name as argument and prints the uncompressed XML data on the console
or writes it to a file given by an optional second argument.
</p>
<p>
The zlib extension is required for this tool.
</p>

<h3>apidoc</h3>

<p>
The "apidoc" subcommand generates/updates the API documentation in the doc/api directory.
</p>
